Javascript 7/30 Array Cardio 2

What I learned:

some checks if one or more elements in array meet criteria

every checks if all elements in array meet criteria

Array.prototype.find()
Find is like filter, but instead returns just the first one you are looking for

Array.prototype.splice()

The splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing existing elements and/or adding new elements.

Array.prototype.findIndex()

The findIndex() method returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise -1 is returned.

See also the find() method, which returns the value of a found element in the array instead of its index.
